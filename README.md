About This Project

Welcome to the Mekdi Restaurant Website! I want to be upfront — this is one of my first web projects, so it might look a little messy in places.
I’m still learning, and I hope you can forgive any imperfections. I built this website purely out of passion for coding and as a fun project to 
practice my skills. Every section, from the booking form to the interactive menu, was created with love and a desire to explore new techniques. 
My goal is to keep improving, learning, and sharing projects like this, and I hope this site gives you a glimpse of my excitement for web development.
